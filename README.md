7.	Write a short essay describing the difference between Abstract Classes and Interfaces

Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, but they can all have some things in common. They are used when a class can only inherit a single abstract class.

Interfaces define method signatures and can't have a state. A class can have multiple interfaces. Therefore, they help to define behaviors that are similar but not related.

Abstract classes and interfaces are used when a group of related classes want to use some common code.

Conclusion

In C#, the main difference between an abstract class and interface is that they can be used in many different ways. Since abstract creates are more about code sharing, they are usually used for classes that are close to each other. Interfaces can be applied to many different classes. Without this difference, - would not have been possible to design something as clean, modular, and scalable applications.
